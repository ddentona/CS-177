\textbf{13.5 Create user stories for the three-ring application}

User Story 1:\\
As a working parent very involved in my two kids' academics and extracurriculars, I want an application to organize my files and describe these organization methods so I can keep track of what documents are for what purpose and open these documents easily when I need them.

User Story 2:\\
As an accountant for a middle to large company, I want a tool in the apps I use to read documents so I can remind myself of what documents have what meanings and properties and I can remember where I need to send them or use them. 

User Story 3:\\
As an analyst at a trading firm, I want to be able to have my volume report documents I regularly analyze automatically downloaded for me to look at when they are released so I can review them in the early morning while commuting (on the train, for example) or while I do not have reliable access to the internet.
